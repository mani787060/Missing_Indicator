# Project: Missing Indicator
 
-> This project focuses on handling missing values using the Missing Indicator technique.
-> The Missing Indicator creates a separate binary feature that shows whether a value was missing or not — preserving valuable information about missingness.

You’ll also see how to perform imputation with and without the Missing Indicator using Scikit-learn.

## Highlights:-
 
-> Understand the concept of Missing Indicator
-> Implement manually using Pandas/Numpy
-> Use Scikit-learn’s MissingIndicator and SimpleImputer
-> Compare results with and without indicator features
-> Visualize how the indicator preserves data patterns

## Libraries Used:-
 
-> pandas
-> numpy
-> sklearn
-> matplotlib

## Goal:-
 
-> To understand how Missing Indicators help retain information about missingness and improve model interpretability during preprocessing.
